web: bin/rails server
worker: bundle exec sidekiq

#Hereâ€™s what they do:

#web: starts your Rails app (like running rails s)

#worker: starts Sidekiq to process background jobs

#Think of it like this:

#The web process handles user requests.

#The worker process handles background tasks (like emails, notifications, etc.).
